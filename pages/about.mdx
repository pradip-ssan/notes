# About Me – Your Instructor

Hello Everyone! I'm Pradip Yadav, and I'm excited to be your instructor in this web development course.

I have more than 10 years of experience as an entrepreneur, where I’ve started and grown different businesses. For the past 5+ years, I’ve also been working as a full-stack web developer using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

I’m also an expert in JavaScript, the most important language for web development.
Over the years, I’ve built many real-world websites and web apps, and I know how to turn ideas into working online projects. My goal is to teach you everything I’ve learned in a simple, practical way — even if you’re a complete beginner.

In this course, you’ll learn step by step how to build your own websites and web applications, with clear explanations and real examples. I’ll guide you just like I would guide my own team.

### Currently, I run my own private limited company (since 2021).

Let’s build something amazing together!
